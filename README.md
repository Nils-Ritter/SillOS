# SillOS

SillOS is a small hobby operating system for x86_64, written in Rust.

The project is intended for learning and experimentation with operating-system development,
including kernel initialization, memory management, hardware access, interrupts,
and bare-metal Rust programming.

> **Status:** Early development

## Features

- x86_64 kernel
- Written in Rust
- `no_std` bare-metal environment
- Bootable using the Limine bootloader
- Serial output for debugging
- Kernel tests running inside QEMU

## Requirements

- Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL
- Rust nightly toolchain
- `rust-src` component
- `llvm-tools-preview` component
- QEMU
- `limine`

Install the Rust components and tools with:

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add rust-src llvm-tools-preview --toolchain nightly
```

On Debian or Ubuntu, install QEMU with:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qemu-system-x86 qemu-utils
```

## Building

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Nils-Ritter/SillOS.git
cd SillOS
```

Build the kernel and create a bootable image:

```sh
make
```

The finished ISOs are placed in the projects root directory.

## Running

Run the operating system in QEMU:

```sh
make run
```

## Testing

Run the kernel tests inside QEMU:

```sh
make test
```

Tests are ran in a custom test harness, results are printed in the serial
console along with the normal kernel output.

```

## Development

Format the source code:

```sh
cargo fmt
```

Check the project without running it:

```sh
cargo check
```

Because SillOS is a bare-metal project,
some standard Rust tooling and libraries are not available inside the kernel.

## Roadmap

- [x] Improve serial logging
- [x] Add interrupt handling
- [ ] Add memory management
- [x] Add a keyboard driver
- [x] Add a basic shell
- [ ] Add a simple heap allocator
- [ ] Improve automated testing
- [ ] Support additional hardware
